The Early Twenties is a podcast that sparks the conversation on navigating our early twenties in a more meaningful way. 

We are a gang of three college friends -- Gyani(23), Sodhi(23) & Shubhu(22), figuring out life in runtime. And we wanna document it, sharing our experiences with the world! 

Every Sunday, one of us takes the lead on a topic that has been most pressing in our professional/social lives, and all of us take it from there :)

We'd love to hear more about you and what you think about this podcast. Hit us up on those little icons below!
