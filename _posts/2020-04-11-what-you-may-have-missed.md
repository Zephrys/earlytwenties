### Putting yourself out there, & being okay with rejections! | Guest episode with Gargi Sharma!

You'll get a lot of rejections, and you'll eventually become good at handling them -- and they sometime suck, but that's the way to live life. You put yourself out there!" -- Gargi Sharma 

On the latest episode of the Early Twenties Podcast, we sit down with Gargi Sharma and dive real real deep into everything under the sun! No seriously, we talk about Systems Programming, Universal Basic Income, Women in Tech & very interestingly, Gargi's favorite Recurse Center!  Gargi graduated with a degree in CS from Pilani in 2017, and has been working at Bloomberg since. 2019 has been her year of exploration, as she has spent six weeks at Recurse Center, and will now be a part of Addiscoder in Ethiopia later this year! We talk about all the tech conferences she's speaking at, and how she managed to get these opportunities. We dive into the experiences women often feel in tech companies, and where the institutional problems arise from, and how reservation might solve that in the short-term future. That, and a lot more packed into this two-hour episode over drinks at Sodhi's place!

### Taking the leap of faith! | Guest episode with digital nomads, Andy Mathews & Gaurav Chandrashekar!

It takes a lot more courage to say, "I don't know, but I'll just give this a shot" and that is very very important. -- Gaurav  

On this episode of the Early Twenties podcast, we sit down with Andy & Gaurav, two digital nomads who have been living the nomadic lifestyle for the better part of the last 3 years! Gaurav has now settled into a one-place lifestyle in Singapore, while Andy is still moving around every three months and is currently based out of Bali.  Gaurav & Andy first met in Dojo Coworking in Bali, and then have travelled to Mexico together -- all while Gaurav explored the Galapagos in Ecuador, learnt Spanish and travelled through Latin & Central America, while Andy skied in the Alps and surfed in Bali! We talk about their remote work lifestlyes, how they view the early twenties as the time to explore, discuss the not-so-good aspects of living as a nomad, and also peek into a couple crazy travel stories! The whole discussion centers around the theme of "Taking the leap", which is good advice when it comes to skydiving, but honestly, it scales really well to almost every aspect of life! If there is one Early Twenties podcast you have to listen to, this is it! And as always, we are looking forward for your feedback(both the good & the bad!) -- shoot it our way, we are @earlytwentiespodcast on Instagram!
