**All work no play makes jack a dull boy. Or does it?**

When you’re gone would you rather have your gravestone say, ‘He never missed a meeting.’ Or one that said, ‘He was a great father.’ - Steve Blank


On this episode of the Early Twenties podcast, the three of us sit down to have a conversation around work-life balance -- we discuss our personal definitions of balance, what we think about on Friday evenings, and also get in an interesting discussion around money and work.
Being weirdo engineers that we are, we discuss about some time-tracking tricks to quantify 'balance' in our lives. We also take on audience responses from our Instagram poll on their definitions of work-life balance. That, and some random Arabic rap from the one and only Arabian superstar, Gyani! 


Hope you derive some value out of this episode, let us know how you liked/hated it! We're always looking forward to your feedback :)
As always,

Tell us what you liked and def tell us what you didn't! and don't forget to share it with someone who might derive value out of this!
