Welcome to the 10th Episode of The Early Twenties Podcast.

On this one, we attempt to discuss Friendships. We talk about the way we try to maintain them, how we create new ones and how much do we actively think about all this. On an absolutely unrelated note, we also discuss [Sodhi's](https://sodhi.xyz) love for telegram!

I feel it's a rather different topic for us and we would love to hear how you felt about this!
No show notes for this one, but I'd like to take this opportunity to look back on the 10 episodes we have created in little over two months now and would like to thank all our listeners who take the time to listen and often reach out to us with feedback or just supportive messages. We absolutely love receiving these and they personally make my day every single time!
