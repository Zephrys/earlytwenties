Yo Yo Yo!

On the last two episodes of the Early Twenties podcast, we sit down with our favourite senior from Pilani, Siddharth Seth! 

This is a 2-part series, one where we time-travel through his journey -- from a 19 year old Seth in Kota, through his university days, running his own startup for two years in Bombay, and now as Director of Products at Koinex!  In this episode we focus on how he decided to shut down Meshup, the startup he founded after leaving his job at Morgan Stanley, his learnings from it,  his journey through Entrepreneur First, his decision to go back to India to join Koinex and finally the advice to his 19 year old self!!

This one really dives into his thinking process and that's what makes it super interesting!
