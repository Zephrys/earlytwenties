In the sixth episode of the early twenties podcast, we move towards a more conversational format and explore topics ranging from  Collateralized loan obligations to Underground communities for music and other things with Siddhant Bhardwaj.

Siddhant, graduated out of BITS Pilani in 2015 and has since been working at Credit Suisse. He is currently based out of New York and loves composing music in his free time.
