*"I was this skinny kid, with thick eyebrows and nerdy glasses. I used to look at the floor while walking -- Nikita Tanwani"*

Nikita, recently crowned Femina Miss India Andhra Pradesh, and previously TGPC Miss India came by on the Early Twenties Podcast! She pursued engineering and graduated in 2017 from BITS Pilani, & has been working as an engineer at Oracle since. She's now a finalist in Miss India and will be representing Andhra Pradesh in this years pageant :)

Nikita shares with us her struggles during her late teens & early twenties, against her parents, against the society. She shares with us her about her setbacks, the backlash against FashP in Pilani, and how she countered her insecurities with mental conditioning. Oh, and also, she completely fangirls over Priyanka Chopra! Tune in to hear much much more!!!

We wish her luck! And and and, when you get the chance, do vote for her!

You can find her almost everywhere on the socials, go say hi :)
