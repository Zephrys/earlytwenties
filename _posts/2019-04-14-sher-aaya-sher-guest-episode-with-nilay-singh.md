**I would go back and slap my 19 year old self and say that, Bro, Books are important!**

On this episode of the podcast, we are joined by Filmmaker, Beatboxer, Drummer, Nilay Singh!
With multiple viral hits under his belt, Nilay, who is currently working as a Director at a Marketing Solutions agency called Schbang, talks about his journey into music and film-making. He touches on his experiences of being from a middle class family and tackling social, peer and family pressures.

Specifically, Nilay also spoke to us about choosing to drop to take another stab at the entrance exams jazz and how that went for him. We spend a lot of time discussing his progress through his Bachelors of Mass Media journey and how he was gigging for five bands during university.

Towards the end we talk about his own venture @stopmotionwaale, how that came into being, what's his plan for the near future and more!
With a lot of stories with drama and comedy packaged into this episode, this will be so worth your time!
